<font size="25"><b>Shipoya Privacy Policy</b></font>
<br><br> <font size="20"><b>Last Updated: 01-01-2016</b></font>
<br>
<br>Welcome to Shipoya! Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through Shipoya’s services platform, available at Shipoya.com and its sub domains and other domains controlled by Shipoya which link to this policy (the “Site”), and through our mobile app (“Shipoya App”), together, the “Shipoya Platform”.  It also covers our offline activities, such as collection of information through telephone, or in person.  Our online and offline activities are referred to as the "Services".
<br>
<br>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through the Shipoya Platform; but it does apply if you access the Shipoya Platform through a third-party website, service or application.

<br><br><font size="20"><b>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</b></font>
<br>
<br>Any information that is collected via the Shipoya Platform is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Shipoya Platform or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.

<br><br><font size="20"><b>Collection and Use of Information</b></font>

<br><br><font size="20"><b>Information Collected or Received from You</b></font>

<br>
<br> Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve the Shipoya Platform and the Shipoya Services, to administer your use of the Shipoya Platform (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate the Shipoya Platform and the Shipoya Services.
Account Information: If you create an Account, including a Business Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, including but not limited to your name, email address, billing address, credit card information and phone number (“PII”). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.
Information You Provide to Shipoya:  In order for us to be able to provide you with Shipoya Services, you will need to provide us with certain information, including transaction related information. For example, if you are a Seller or a SaaS Subscriber, you need to provide us information like the rates, tariffs and prices for your Freight Services. If you are a Buyer, you need to provide us with information about the shipment you want to make. It’s possible that some of this information, such as the physical address or pick up location for the shipment, may be PII.  In addition to collecting this information through your Account, we may collect information during email or telephone communications with you in the context of a transaction that you enter into through the Shipoya Platform. For example, if you are a Buyer and you choose to book a Quote, we may contact you directly to find out more information about the shipment you are making. We will also collect and store information about the transactions you enter into, such as information about the Freight Services you purchase or sell through the Shipoya Platform.
Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies: Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.
“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access the Shipoya Platform. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Shipoya Platform and to tell us how and when you interact with the Shipoya Platform. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Shipoya Platform and to customize and improve the Shipoya Platform. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.
“Web Beacons” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on the Shipoya Platform for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of the Shipoya Platform, to monitor how many visitors view the Shipoya Platform, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).
Information Related to Use of the Shipoya Platform: Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses the Shipoya Platform (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing the Shipoya Platform, the pages or features of the Shipoya Platform to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on the Shipoya Platform that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Shipoya Platform and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance the Shipoya Platform by expanding its features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how the Shipoya Platform is used.
Information Sent by Your Mobile Device: We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use the Shipoya Platform from a mobile device, including the Shipoya App, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of the Shipoya Platform.
Location Information: If you use the Shipoya App, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize the Shipoya App for you.  In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our Services, such as geographic areas. Vehicles with shipments being transported through the Shipoya platform are tracked via GPS coordinates sent to our servers. We collect this information for various purposes, including to provide you with support, to notify carriers as soon as shipments are available nearby, to keep consignees informed of arrival times, to help dispatchers or shippers know where drivers are headed, to enhance our Services, and for our internal business purposes.

<br><br><font size="20"><b>Information that We Share with Third Parties</b></font>
<br>
<br>We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:
Information Shared with other Account Holders:  We will share certain PII about you with other Account holders in connection with performance of the Shipoya Services and provision of the Shipoya Platform to you.
Information Shared with Our Services Providers: We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to operate the Shipoya Platform and to provide the Shipoya Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf. Third party service providers also work on website or application development, hosting, maintenance, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to and/or process your information, including Personal Information, in connection with providing these services.  Such third party providers agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
Information Shared with Third Parties: We may share aggregate, anonymous, and statistical data with third parties, including other users of the Shipoya Platform, for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes. We utilize Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. that we use to gather information about how users engage with the Shipoya Platform. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. We also use MixPanel to provide us with analytics data regarding users’ interactions with the Shipoya Platform. Users may opt out by visiting https://mixpanel.com/optout/. We may use other such tools from time to time. We will not share information with third parties for direct marketing purposes.
Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions: Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Therefore, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
